**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
*On 1/29/2020 UST Events application was refactored to Summit Events App. This means all classes, objects, visualfoce pages, and text have been refactored to reflect the new name. Previous installed version of the application will need to be reinstalled to proceed with this update. This is a turning point in the project and it is our intention that this be the last of drastic architecture changes that is made.*
